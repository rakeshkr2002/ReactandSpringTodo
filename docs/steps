Connecting React Frontend with Spring Boot Backend: in 7 Step

In modern web development, it's common to use separate frameworks for frontend and backend. React.js for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend is a powerful combination. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of connecting a React frontend to a Spring Boot backend.

Set Up Your Spring Boot Backend:

Start by creating a new Spring Boot project using your preferred IDE or Spring Initializr.
Define your RESTful APIs using Spring MVC, mapping endpoints to controller methods.

Implement CORS Configuration:

To allow cross-origin requests from your React frontend, configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in your Spring Boot application.
You can do this by adding @CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000") annotation to your controller classes or by configuring it globally.

Build Your React Frontend:

Create a new React project using Create React App or any other preferred method.
Design your UI components using JSX and CSS to create a user-friendly interface.

Fetch Data from the Backend:

Use Axios or fetch API to make HTTP requests from your React components to the Spring Boot backend.
For example, you can use axios.get('http://localhost:8080/api/data') to retrieve data from the backend.

Handle Backend Responses:

Handle the responses received from the backend in your React components.
Update the UI accordingly by displaying the fetched data or handling errors gracefully.

Send Data to the Backend:

Implement forms or user interactions in your React frontend to send data to the backend.
Use POST, PUT, or DELETE requests to send data to the corresponding endpoints in your Spring Boot backend.

Testing and Debugging:

Test your application thoroughly to ensure that data is being exchanged correctly between the frontend and backend.
